of her sex', 'it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler', 'all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind', 'he was i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position', 'he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer', 'they were admirable things for the observerexcellent for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions', 'but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results', 'grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his', 'and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable memory', 'i had seen little of holmes lately', 'my marriage had drifted us away from each other', 'my own complete happiness and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature', 'he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police', 'from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland', 'beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of my former friend and companion', 'one nightit was on the twentieth of march 1888i was returning from a journey to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through baker street', 'as i passed the wellremembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers', 'his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind', 'he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him', 'to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story', 'he was at work again', 'he had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem', 'i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own', 'his manner was not effusive', 'it seldom was but he was glad i think to see me', 'with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner', 'then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion', 'wedlock suits you he remarked', 'i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you', 'seven', 'i answered', 'indeed i should have thought a little more', 'just a trifle more i fancy watson', 'and in practice again i observe', 'you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness', 'then how do you know', 'i see it i deduce it', 'how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl', 'my dear holmes said i this is too much', 'you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago', 'it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it', 'as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out', 'he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together', 'it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts', 'obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it', 'hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the london slavey', 'as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession', 'i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction', 'when i hear you give your reasons i remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process', 'and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours', 'quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair', 'you see but you do not observe', 'the distinction is clear', 'for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room', 'frequently', 'how often', 'well some hundreds of times', 'then how many are there', 'how many', 'i dont know', 'quite so', 'you have not observed', 'and yet you have seen', 'that is just my point', 'now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed', 'by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this', 'he threw over a sheet of thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table', 'it came by the last post said he', 'read it aloud', 'the note was undated and without either signature or address', 'there will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment', 'your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated', 'this account of you we have from all quarters received', 'be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask', 'this is indeed a mystery i remarked', 'what do you imagine that it means', 'i have no data yet', 'it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data', 'insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts', 'but the note itself', 'what do you deduce from it', 'i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written', 'the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes', 'such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet', 'it is peculiarly strong and stiff', 'peculiarthat is the very word said holmes', 'it is not an english paper at all', 'hold it up to the light', 'i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper', 'what do you make of that', 'asked holmes', 'the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather', 'not at all', 'the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft which is the german for company', 'it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier', 'now for the eg', 'let us glance at our continental gazetteer']\n",

it the second afghan war had broken out', 'on landing at bombay i learned that my corps had advanced through the passes and was already deep in the enemys country', 'i followed however with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself and succeeded in reaching candahar in safety where i found my regiment and at once entered upon my new duties', 'the campaign brought honours and promotion to many but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster', 'i was removed from my brigade and attached to the berkshires with whom i served at the fatal battle of maiwand', 'there i was struck on the shoulder by a jezail bullet which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery', 'i should have fallen into the hands of the murderous ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by murray my orderly who threw me across a packhorse and succeeded in bringing me safely to the british lines', 'worn with pain and weak from the prolonged hardships which i had undergone i was removed with a great train of wounded sufferers to the base hospital at peshawar', 'here i rallied and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards and even to bask a little upon the verandah when i was struck down by enteric fever that curse of our indian possessions', 'for months my life was despaired of and when at last i came to myself and became convalescent i was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to england', 'i was dispatched accordingly in the troopship orontes and landed a month later on portsmouth jetty with my health irretrievably ruined but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it', 'i had neither kith nor kin in england and was therefore as free as airor as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be', 'under such circumstances i naturally gravitated to london that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the empire are irresistibly drained', 'there i stayed for some time at a private hotel in the strand leading a comfortless meaningless existence and spending such money as i had considerably more freely than i ought', 'so alarming did the state of my finances become that i soon realized that i must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country or that i must make a complete alteration in my style of living', 'choosing the latter alternative i began by making up my mind to leave the hotel and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile', 'on the very day that i had come to this conclusion i was standing at the criterion bar when some one tapped me on the shoulder and turning round i recognized young stamford who had been a dresser under me at barts', 'the sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of london is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man', 'in old days stamford had never been a particular crony of mine but now i hailed him with enthusiasm and he in his turn appeared to be delighted to see me', 'in the exuberance of my joy i asked him to lunch with me at the holborn and we started off together in a hansom', 'whatever have you been doing with yourself watson', 'he asked in undisguised wonder as we rattled through the crowded london streets', 'you are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut', 'i gave him a short sketch of my adventures and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination', 'poor devil', 'he said commiseratingly after he had listened to my misfortunes', 'what are you up to now', 'looking for lodgings', '3 i answered', 'trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price', 'thats a strange thing remarked my companion you are the second man today that has used that expression to me', 'and who was the first', 'i asked', 'a fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital', 'he was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found and which were too much for his purse', 'by jove', 'i cried if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense i am the very man for him', 'i should prefer having a partner to being alone', 'young stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wineglass', 'you dont know sherlock holmes yet he said perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion', 'why what is there against him', 'oh i didnt say there was anything against him', 'he is a little queer in his ideasan enthusiast in some branches of science', 'as far as i know he is a decent fellow enough', 'a medical student i suppose', 'said i  noi have no idea what he intends to go in for', 'i believe he is well up in anatomy and he is a firstclass chemist but as far as i know he has never taken out any systematic medical classes', 'his studies are very desultory and eccentric but he has amassed a lot of outofthe way knowledge which would astonish his professors', 'did you never ask him what he was going in for', 'i asked', 'no he is not a man that it is easy to draw out though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him', 'i should like to meet him i said', 'if i am to lodge with anyone i should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits', 'i am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement', 'i had enough of both in afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence', 'how could i meet this friend of yours', 'he is sure to be at the laboratory returned my companion', 'he either avoids the place for weeks or else he works there from morning to night', 'if you like we shall drive round together after luncheon', 'certainly i answered and the conversation drifted away into other channels', 'as we made our way to the hospital after leaving the holborn stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom i proposed to take as a fellowlodger', 'you mustnt blame me if you dont get on with him he said i know nothing more of him than i have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory', 'you proposed this arrangement so you must not hold me responsible', 'if we dont get on it will be easy to part company i answered', 'it seems to me stamford i added looking hard at my companion that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter', 'is this fellows temper so formidable or what is it', 'dont be mealymouthed about it', 'it is not easy to express the inexpressible he answered with a laugh', 'holmes is a little too scientific for my tastesit approaches to coldbloodedness', 'i could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid not out of malevolence you understand but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects', 'to do him justice i think that he would take it himself with the same readiness', 'he appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge', 'ery right too', 'yes but it may be pushed to excess', 'when it comes to beating the subjects in the dissectingrooms with a stick it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape', 'beating the subjects', 'yes to verify how far bruises may be produced after death', 'i saw him at it with my own eyes', 'and yet you say he is not a medical student', 'no', 'heaven knows what the objects of his studies are', 'but here we are and you must form your own impressions about him', 'as he spoke we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small sidedoor which opened into a wing of the great hospital', 'it was familiar ground to me and i needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and duncoloured doors', 'near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory', 'this was a lofty chamber lined and littered with countless bottles', 'broad low tables were scattered about which bristled with retorts testtubes and little bunsen lamps with their blue flickering flames', 'there was only one student in the room who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work', 'at the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure', 'ive found it', 'ive found it he shouted to my companion running towards us with a testtube in his hand', 'i have found a reagent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin 4 and by nothing else', 'had he discovered a gold mine greater delight could not have shone upon his features', 'dr watson mr sherlock holmes said stamford introducing us', 'how are you', 'he said cordially gripping my hand with a strength for which i should hardly have given him credit', 'you have been in afghanistan i perceive']\n",

honourable ronald adair under most unusual and inexplicable       circumstances', 'the public has already learned those particulars       of the crime which came out in the police investigation but a       good deal was suppressed upon that occasion since the case for       the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not       necessary to bring forward all the facts', 'only now at the end of       nearly ten years am i allowed to supply those missing links       which make up the whole of that remarkable chain', 'the crime was       of interest in itself but that interest was as nothing to me       compared to the inconceivable sequel which afforded me the       greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life', 'even now after this long interval i find myself thrilling as i       think of it and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy       amazement and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind', 'let       me say to that public which has shown some interest in those       glimpses which i have occasionally given them of the thoughts and       actions of a very remarkable man that they are not to blame me       if i have not shared my knowledge with them for i should have       considered it my first duty to do so had i not been barred by a       positive prohibition from his own lips which was only withdrawn       upon the third of last month', 'it can be imagined that my close intimacy with sherlock holmes       had interested me deeply in crime and that after his       disappearance i never failed to read with care the various       problems which came before the public', 'and i even attempted more       than once for my own private satisfaction to employ his methods       in their solution though with indifferent success',

person or persons unknown       i realized more clearly than i had ever done the loss which the       community had sustained by the death of sherlock holmes', 'there       were points about this

observation and the alert mind of the first criminal       agent in europe', 'all day as i drove upon my round i turned over       the case in my mind and found no explanation which appeared to me       to be adequate', 'at the risk of telling a twicetold tale i will       recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the       conclusion of the inquest', 'the honourable ronald adair was the second son of the earl of       maynooth at that time governor of one of the australian       colonies', 'adairs mother had returned from australia to undergo       the operation for cataract and she her son ronald and her       daughter hilda were living together at 427 park lane', 'the youth       moved in the best societyhad so far as was known no enemies       and no particular vices',

profound feeling behind it', 'for the rest the       mans life moved in a narrow and conventional circle for his       habits were quiet and his nature unemotional', 'yet it was upon       this easygoing young aristocrat that death came in most strange       and unexpected form between the hours of ten and eleventwenty       on the night of march 30        ronald adair was fond of cardsplaying continually but never for       such stakes as would hurt him', 'he was a member of the baldwin       the cavendish and the bagatelle card clubs', 'it was shown that       after dinner on the day of his death he had played a rubber of       whist at the latter club', 'he had also played there in the       afternoon', 'the evidence of those who had played with himmr', 'murray sir john

considerable one and such a loss could not in any way affect       him', 'he had played nearly every day at one club or other but he       was a cautious player and usually rose a winner', 'it came out in       evidence that in partnership with colonel moran he had actually       won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting some       weeks before from godfrey milner and lord balmoral', 'so much for       his recent history as it came out at the inquest', 'on the evening of the crime he returned from the club exactly at       ten', 'his mother and sister were out spending the evening with a       relation', 'the servant deposed that she heard him enter the front       room on the second floor generally used as his sittingroom', 'she       had lit a fire there and as it

two banknotes for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in       silver and gold the money arranged in little piles of varying       amount', 'there were some figures also upon a sheet of paper with       the names of some club friends opposite to them from which it       was conjectured that before his death he was endeavouring to make       out his losses or winnings at cards', 'a minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the       case more complex', 'in the first place no reason could be given       why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside', 'there was the possibility that the murderer had done this and       had afterwards escaped by the window', 'the drop was at least       twenty feet however and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay       beneath', 'neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of       having been disturbed nor were there any marks upon the narrow       strip of grass which separated the house from the road', 'apparently therefore it was the young man himself who had       fastened the door', 'but how did he come by his death', 'no one could       have climbed up to the window without leaving traces',

there is a cab stand       within a hundred yards of the house', 'no one had heard a shot', 'and       yet there was the dead man and there the revolver bullet which       had mushroomed out as softnosed bullets will and so inflicted       a wound which must have caused instantaneous death', 'such were the       circumstances of the park lane mystery which were further       complicated by entire absence of motive since as i have said       young adair was not known to have any enemy and no attempt had       been made to remove the money or valuables in the room', 'all day i turned

startingpoint of every investigation', 'i confess that i made       little progress', 'in the evening i strolled across the park and       found myself about six oclock at the oxford street end of

could but his       observations seemed to me to be absurd so i withdrew again in       some disgust', 'as i did so i struck against an elderly deformed       man who had been behind me and i knocked down several books       which he was carrying', 'i remember that as i picked them up i       observed the title of one of them the origin of tree worship       and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile       who either as a trade or as a hobby was a collector of obscure       volumes', 'i endeavoured to apologize for the accident but it was       evident that these books which i had so unfortunately maltreated       were very precious objects in the eyes of their owner', 'with a       snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel and i saw his curved       back and white

a low wall and railing the whole not more than       five feet high', 'it was perfectly easy therefore for anyone to       get into the garden but the window was entirely inaccessible       since
